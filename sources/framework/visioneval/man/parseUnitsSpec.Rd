\code{parseUnitsSpec} parses the UNITS attribute of a standard Inp, Get, or
Set specification for a dataset to identify the units name, multiplier, and
year for currency data. Returns a modified specifications list whose UNITS
value is only the units name, and includes a MULTIPLIER attribute and YEAR
attribute.

The UNITS component of a specifications list can encode information in
addition to the units name. This includes a value units multiplier and in
the case of currency values the year for the currency measurement. The
multiplier element can only be expressed in scientific notation where the
number before the 'e' can only be 1.
