\title{Expand a Inp, Get, or Set specification so that is can be used by other
functions to process inputs and to read from or write to the datastore.}
\usage{
expandSpec(SpecToExpand_ls)
}
\arguments{
\item{SpecToExpand_ls}{A standard specifications list for a specification
whose NAME attribute has multiple values.}
}
\value{
A list of standard specifications lists which has a component for
each value in the NAME attribute of the input specifications list.
}
\description{
\code{expandSpec} takes a Inp, Get, or Set specification and processes it to
be in a form that can be used by other functions which use the specification
in processing inputs or reading from or writing to the datastore. The
parseUnitsSpec function is called to parse the UNITS attribute to extract
name, multiplier, and year values. When the specification has multiple
values for the NAME attribute, the function creates a specification for each
name value.
}
\details{
The VisionEval design allows module developers to assign multiple values to
the NAME attributes of a Inp, Get, or Set specification where the other
attributes for those named datasets (or fields) are the same. This greatly
reduces duplication and the potential for error in writing module
specifications. However, other functions that check or use the specifications
are not capable of handling specifications which have NAME attributes
containing multiple values. This function expands a specification with
multiple values for a  NAME attribute into multiple specifications, each with
a single value for the NAME attribute. In addition, the function calls the
parseUnitsSpec function to extract multiplier and year information from the
value of the UNITS attribute. See that function for details.
