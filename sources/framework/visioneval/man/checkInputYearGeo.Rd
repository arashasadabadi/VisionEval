\usage{
checkInputYearGeo(Year_, Geo_, Group, Table)
}
\arguments{
\item{Year_}{the vector extract of the 'Year' column from the input data.}

\item{Geo_}{the vector extract of the 'Geo' column from the input data.}

\item{Group}{a string identifying the 'GROUP' specification for the data sets
contained in the input file.}

\item{Table}{a string identifying the 'TABLE' specification for the data sets
contained in the input file.}
}
\value{
A list containing the results of the check. The list has two

geographic areas. 'DupInput' identifies where are any redundant year and
geography entries. If 'CompleteInput' is FALSE, the list contains a
'MissingInputs' component that is a string identifying the missing year and
