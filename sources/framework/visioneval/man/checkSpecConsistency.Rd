\usage{
checkSpecConsistency(Spec_ls, DstoreAttr_)
}
\arguments{
\item{Spec_ls}{a list of data specifications consistent with a module "Get"
or "Set" specifications.}

\item{DstoreAttr_}{a named list where the components are the attributes of a
dataset.}
}
\value{
A list containing two components, Errors and Warnings. If no
  inconsistencies are found, both components will have zero-length character

  error messages.
