#SECTION 3: DEFINE FUNCTIONS THAT IMPLEMENT THE SUBMODEL
#=======================================================
#This function locates households in Bzones based on the housing type of each
#household, the supply of housing of that housing type in each Bzone, the
#income of the household, and the Bzone location weight of each household.
#First housing supply and demand are balanced to assure that there are
#sufficient housing units of each type in the Azone. Then households are ordered
#by income from highest to lowest. Each household is assign a Bzone in that
#order. The probability of a household being assigned to a Bzone is a function
#of the supply of housing of the type in the Bzone and the location weight of
#the Bzone. After a household has been assigned to a Bzone, the housing
#inventory of the Bzone is decremented and the next household is then assigned.

#Function to adjust supply of dwelling units to match demand
#-----------------------------------------------------------
#' Adjusts supply of housing to match total demand for a housing type
#'
#' \code{adjustHousingSupply} adjusts housing supply in each Bzone so that the
#' total matches housing demand for a housing type
#'
#' Although the function which assigns a housing type to each household closely
#' matches the proportions of housing by type, it does not exactly match the
#' proportions. Furthermore the dwelling unit input numbers may not exactly
#' match the total number of households. For these reasons, the supply of
#' dwelling units by type may not match the demand. This function adjusts the
#' supply so that it matches demand. The units of a type in each Bzone are
#' adjusted in proportion to the total number of units of that type.
#'
#' @param TotUnitTarget An number identifying the total number of units demanded.
#' @param Units_Bz A named numeric vector identifying the number of dwelling
#' units of the type in each Bzone.
#' @return A list having two components:
#' BalancedUnits_Bz A named numeric vector giving the number of units by Bzone
#' which matches total demand, and
#' AdjUnits_Bz A named numeric vector giving the amount of adjustment that was
#' made to the original number of units in each Bzone.
adjustHousingSupply <- function(TotUnitTarget, Units_Bz) {
  UnitProbs_Bz <- Units_Bz / sum(Units_Bz)

  )
}

#Function to choose Bzone locations for households
#-------------------------------------------------
#' Assigns Bzones for set of households
#'
#' \code{chooseLocations} assigns Bzones to households based on number of
#' dwelling units in each Bzone and Bzone weights.
#'
#' This function assigns Bzone locations to households for a specified housing
#' type. Households are assigned to Bzones in descending order of their
#' incomes (e.g. highest income household gets first choice). The probability
#' that a household is assigned a Bzone is a function of the number of
#' available housing units in each Bzone and attraction weights of each Bzone.
#'
#' @param SortedHhIds_ A character vector of household IDs sorted in descending
#' order of household income.
#' @param Capacity_Bz A numeric named vector of the number of dwelling units
#' in each Bzone named with the Bzone names.
#' @param Weights_Bz A numeric named vector of attraction weights by Bzone
#' named with the Bzone names.
#' @return A named character vector of Bzones named with the corresponding
#' household IDs.

#SECTION 4: TEST CODE
#====================
#The following code is useful for testing and module function development. The
#first part initializes a datastore, loads inputs, and checks that the datastore
#contains the data needed to run the module. The second part produces a list of
#the data the module function will be provided by the framework when it is run.
#This is useful to have when developing the module function. The third part
#runs the whole module to check that everything runs correctly and that the
#module outputs are consistent with specifications. Note that if a module
#requires data produced by another module, the test code for the other module
#must be run first so that the datastore contains the requisite data. Also note
#that it is important that all of the test code is commented out when the
#the package is built.

#1) Test code to set up datastore and return module specifications
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#The following commented-out code can be run to initialize a datastore, load
#inputs, and check that the datastore contains the data needed to run the
#module. It return the processed module specifications which can be used in
#conjunction with the getFromDatastore function to fetch the list of data needed
#by the module. Note that the following code assumes that all the data required
#to set up a datastore are in the defs and inputs directories in the tests
#directory. All files in the defs directory must have the default names.
#
# Specs_ls <- testModule(
#   ModuleName = "LocateHouseholds",
#   LoadDatastore = TRUE,
#   SaveDatastore = TRUE,
#   DoRun = FALSE
# )
#
#2) Test code to create a list of module inputs to use in module function
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#The following commented-out code can be run to create a list of module inputs
#that may be used in the development of module functions. Note that the data
#will be returned for the first year in the run years specified in the
#run_parameters.json file. Also note that if the RunBy specification is not
#Region, the code will by default return the data for the first geographic area
#in the datastore.
#
# setwd("tests")
# Year <- getYears()[1]
# if (Specs_ls$RunBy == "Region") {
#   L <- getFromDatastore(Specs_ls, RunYear = Year, Geo = NULL)
# } else {
#   GeoCategory <- Specs_ls$RunBy
#   Geo_ <- readFromTable(GeoCategory, GeoCategory, Year)
#   L <- getFromDatastore(Specs_ls, RunYear = Year, Geo = Geo_[1])
#   rm(GeoCategory, Geo_)
# }
# rm(Year)
# setwd("..")
#
#3) Test code to run full module tests
#-------------------------------------
#Run the following commented-out code after the module functions have been
#written to test all aspects of the module including whether the module can be
#run and whether the module will produce results that are consistent with the
#module's Set specifications. It is also important to run this code if one or
#more other modules in the package need the dataset(s) produced by this module.
#
# testModule(
#   ModuleName = "LocateHouseholds",
#   LoadDatastore = TRUE,
#   SaveDatastore = TRUE,
#   DoRun = TRUE
# )
