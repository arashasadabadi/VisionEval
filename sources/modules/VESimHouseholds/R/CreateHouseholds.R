#SECTION 1: ESTIMATE AND SAVE MODEL PARAMETERS
#=============================================
#This model has just one parameter object, a matrix of the probability that a
#person in each age group is in one of several hundred household types.
#Each household type is denoted by the number of persons in each age group in
#the household. The rows of the matrix correspond to the household types.
#The columns of the matrix correspond to the 6 age groups. Each column of the
#matrix sums to 1. The process selects the most frequently observed households.
#The default is to select the most frequent households which account for 99% of
#all households.

#Define a function to estimate household size proportion parameters

#' probabilities.

#' age groups is in one of many household types where each household type is
#' determined by the number of persons in each age category.

#' @param Threshold A number between 0 and 1 identifying the percentile
#' cutoff for determining the most prevalent households.

#SECTION 3: DEFINE FUNCTIONS THAT IMPLEMENT THE SUBMODEL
#=======================================================
#This function creates households for the entire model region. A household table
#is created and this is populated with the household size and persons by age
#characteristics of all the households.

#Function that creates set of households for an Azone
#----------------------------------------------------
#' Create simulated households for an Azone
#'
#' \code{createHhByAge} creates a set of simulated households for an Azone that
#' reasonably represents a population census or forecast of persons in each of 6
#' age categories.
#'
#' This function creates a set of simulated households for an Azone that
#' reasonably represents the population census or forecast of persons in each of
#' 6 age categories: 0 to 14, 15 to 19, 20 to 29, 30 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65
#' plus. The function uses a matrix of probabilities that a person in each age
#' group might be present in each of 524 household types. This matrix
#' (HtProb_HtAp) is estimated by the calcHhAgeTypes function which is described
#' above. Household types are distinguished by the number of persons in each age
#' category in the household. The function fits the distribution of households
#' by type by iteratively applying the probability matrix to the population,
#' reconciling households allocated by type based on the population assigned,
#' recomputing the assigned population, calculating the difference between the
#' assigned population by age and the input population by age, recalculating the
#' probabilities, and assigning the population difference. This process
#' continues until the difference between the assigned population and the input
#' population by age group is less than 0.1%. After the households are
#' synthesized, the size of each household is calculated.
#'
#' @param Prsn_Ap A named vector containing the number of persons in each age
#'   category.
#' @param MaxIter An integer specifying the maximum number of iterations the
#' algorithm should use to balance and reconcile the population allocation to
#' household types.
#' @param TargetHhSize A double specifying a household size target value or NA
#' if there is no target.
#' @param TargetProp1PerHh A double specifying a target for the proportion of
#' households that are one-person households or NA if there is no target.
#' @return A list containing 7 components. Each component is a vector where each
#'   element of a vector corresponds to a simulated household. The components
#'   are as follows:
#' Age0to14 - number of persons age 0 to 14 in the household
#' Age15to19 - number of persons age 15 to 19 in the household
#' Age20to29 - number of persons age 20 to 29 in the household
#' Age30to54 - number of persons age 30 to 54 in the household
#' Age 55to64 - number of persons age 55 to 64 in the household
#' Age65Plus - number of persons 65 or older in the household
#' HhSize - total number of persons in the household

#Main module function that creates simulated households
#------------------------------------------------------
#' Main module function to create simulated households
#'
#' \code{CreateHouseholds} creates a set of simulated households that each have
#' a unique household ID, an Azone to which it is assigned, household
#' size (number of people in the household), and numbers of persons in each of
#' 6 age categories.
#'
#' This function creates a set of simulated households for the model region
#' where each household is assigned a household size, an Azone, a unique ID, and
#' numbers of persons in each of 6 age categories. The function calls the
#' createHhByAge and createGrpHhByAge functions for each Azone to create
#' simulated households containing persons by age category from a vector of
#' persons by age category for the Azone. The list of vectors produced by the
#' Create Households function are to be stored in the "Household" table. Since
#' this table does not exist, the function calculates a LENGTH value for the
#' table and returns that as well. The framework uses this information to
#' initialize the Households table. The function also computes the maximum
#' numbers of characters in the HhId and Azone datasets and assigns these to a
#' SIZE vector. This is necessary so that the framework can initialize these
#' datasets in the datastore. All the results are returned in a list.
#'
#' @param L A list containing the components listed in the Get specifications
#' for the module.
#' @return A list containing the components specified in the Set
#' specifications for the module along with:
#' LENGTH: A named integer vector having a single named element, "Household",
#' which identifies the length (number of rows) of the Household table to be
#' created in the datastore.
#' SIZE: A named integer vector having two elements. The first element, "Azone",
#' identifies the size of the longest Azone name. The second element, "HhId",
#' identifies the size of the longest HhId.

#SECTION 4: TEST CODE
#====================
#The following code is useful for testing and module function development. The
#first part initializes a datastore, loads inputs, and checks that the datastore
#contains the data needed to run the module. The second part produces a list of
#the data the module function will be provided by the framework when it is run.
#This is useful to have when developing the module function. The third part
#runs the whole module to check that everything runs correctly and that the
#module outputs are consistent with specifications. Note that if a module
#requires data produced by another module, the test code for the other module
#must be run first so that the datastore contains the requisite data. Also note
#that it is important that all of the test code is commented out when the
#the package is built.

#1) Test code to set up datastore and return module specifications
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#The following commented-out code can be run to initialize a datastore, load
#inputs, and check that the datastore contains the data needed to run the
#module. It return the processed module specifications which can be used in
#conjunction with the getFromDatastore function to fetch the list of data needed
#by the module. Note that the following code assumes that all the data required
#to set up a datastore are in the defs and inputs directories in the tests
#directory. All files in the defs directory must have the default names.
#
# Specs_ls <- testModule(
#   ModuleName = "CreateHouseholds",
#   LoadDatastore = FALSE,
#   SaveDatastore = TRUE,
#   DoRun = FALSE
# )
#
#2) Test code to create a list of module inputs to use in module function
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#The following commented-out code can be run to create a list of module inputs
#that may be used in the development of module functions. Note that the data
#will be returned for the first year in the run years specified in the
#run_parameters.json file. Also note that if the RunBy specification is not
#Region, the code will by default return the data for the first geographic area
#in the datastore.
#
# setwd("tests")
# Year <- getYears()[1]
# if (Specs_ls$RunBy == "Region") {
#   L <- getFromDatastore(Specs_ls, RunYear = Year, Geo = NULL)
# } else {
#   GeoCategory <- Specs_ls$RunBy
#   Geo_ <- readFromTable(GeoCategory, GeoCategory, Year)
#   L <- getFromDatastore(Specs_ls, RunYear = Year, Geo = Geo_[1])
#   rm(GeoCategory, Geo_)
# }
# rm(Year)
# setwd("..")
#
#3) Test code to run full module tests
#-------------------------------------
#Run the following commented-out code after the module functions have been
#written to test all aspects of the module including whether the module can be
#run and whether the module will produce results that are consistent with the
#module's Set specifications. It is also important to run this code if one or
#more other modules in the package need the dataset(s) produced by this module.
#
# testModule(
#   ModuleName = "CreateHouseholds",
#   LoadDatastore = FALSE,
#   SaveDatastore = TRUE,
#   DoRun = TRUE
# )
