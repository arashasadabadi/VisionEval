#PredictWorkers.R
#================
#This module assigns workers by age to households and to noninstitutional group
#quarters population. It is a simple model which predicts workers as a function
#of the household type and age composition. There is no responsiveness to jobs
#or how changes in the job market and demographics might change the worker age
#composition.

#SECTION 1: ESTIMATE AND SAVE MODEL PARAMETERS
#=============================================
#The worker model predicts workers as a function of the household type:
#i.e. the number of persons in each of 6 age groups in the household. It is a
#simple stochastic model where the probability that a person in an age group in
#a household type is a worker is the ratio of workers to persons in that age
#group and household type. For the noninstitutionalized group quarters
#population, the probability is the ratio of workers to persons by age group.

#Define a function to estimate worker model parameters
#-----------------------------------------------------
#' Calculate worker model parameters
#'
#' \code{calcWorkerProportions} creates a matrix of proportions of persons who
#' are workers by household type and age group for regular households and for
#' the noninstitutionalized group quarters population.
#'
#' This function creates a matrix of proportions of persons who are workers by
#' household type and age group for regular households and for the
#' noninstitutionalized group quarters population. The rows are named by the
#' household type names which for regular households are strings with the
#' number of persons by age group separated by hyphens and is Grp for the
#' noninstitutionalized group quarters population. These names correspond to
#' values in the HhType dataset in the Household table of the datastore.
#'
#' @return A matrix of the proportions of persons who are workers by household
#' type and age group. Where the row names are the household type (HhType)
#' names and the column names are the age group names.

#SECTION 4: TEST CODE
#====================
#The following code is useful for testing and module function development. The
#first part initializes a datastore, loads inputs, and checks that the datastore
#contains the data needed to run the module. The second part produces a list of
#the data the module function will be provided by the framework when it is run.
#This is useful to have when developing the module function. The third part
#runs the whole module to check that everything runs correctly and that the
#module outputs are consistent with specifications. Note that if a module
#requires data produced by another module, the test code for the other module
#must be run first so that the datastore contains the requisite data. Also note
#that it is important that all of the test code is commented out when the
#the package is built.

#1) Test code to set up datastore and return module specifications
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#The following commented-out code can be run to initialize a datastore, load
#inputs, and check that the datastore contains the data needed to run the
#module. It return the processed module specifications which can be used in
#conjunction with the getFromDatastore function to fetch the list of data needed
#by the module. Note that the following code assumes that all the data required
#to set up a datastore are in the defs and inputs directories in the tests
#directory. All files in the defs directory must have the default names.
#
# Specs_ls <- testModule(
#   ModuleName = "PredictWorkers",
#   LoadDatastore = TRUE,
#   SaveDatastore = TRUE,
#   DoRun = FALSE
# )
#
#2) Test code to create a list of module inputs to use in module function
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#The following commented-out code can be run to create a list of module inputs
#that may be used in the development of module functions. Note that the data
#will be returned for the first year in the run years specified in the
#run_parameters.json file. Also note that if the RunBy specification is not
#Region, the code will by default return the data for the first geographic area
#in the datastore.
#
# setwd("tests")
# Year <- getYears()[1]
# if (Specs_ls$RunBy == "Region") {
#   L <- getFromDatastore(Specs_ls, RunYear = Year, Geo = NULL)
# } else {
#   GeoCategory <- Specs_ls$RunBy
#   Geo_ <- readFromTable(GeoCategory, GeoCategory, Year)
#   L <- getFromDatastore(Specs_ls, RunYear = Year, Geo = Geo_[1])
#   rm(GeoCategory, Geo_)
# }
# rm(Year)
# setwd("..")
#
#3) Test code to run full module tests
#-------------------------------------
#Run the following commented-out code after the module functions have been
#written to test all aspects of the module including whether the module can be
#run and whether the module will produce results that are consistent with the
#module's Set specifications. It is also important to run this code if one or
#more other modules in the package need the dataset(s) produced by this module.
#
# testModule(
#   ModuleName = "PredictWorkers",
#   LoadDatastore = TRUE,
#   SaveDatastore = TRUE,
#   DoRun = TRUE
# )
